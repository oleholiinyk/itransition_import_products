**The problem**

In order to add some new and exciting products to the site, we need to process a CSV file

from a supplier.

This file contains product information which we need to extract and insert into a database

table.

In addition, we need to apply some simple business rules to the data we import. A table

already exists to receive this information, but the table needs some tweaks in order to work

correctly with this file.

**The Solution**

You need to create a mechanism which will read the CSV file, parse the contents and then insert

the data into a MySQL database table.

The import process will be run from the command line and when it completes it needs to

report how many items were processed, how many were successful, and how many were

skipped. See the import rules below.

**Objectives**

Your solution must be OO, based on Any PHP framework (Symfony, Laravel, etc) and use MySQL. Code should be clearly laid
out, well commented and <a name="ole_link3"></a>c<a name="ole_link4"></a>o<a name="ole_link5"></a>vered by unit tests.

Any SQL used to alter the table should be included as migration scripts with the submission.

Using a command line argument the script can be run in 'test' mode. This will perform

everything the normal import does, but not insert the data into the database.

The supplier provides a stock level and price which we currently do not store. Using

suitable data types, add two columns to the table to capture this information.

Result should be presented as a pull request that contains only code related to the problem (excluding initial framework
project commit).

**Import Rules**

Any stock item which costs less that $5 and has less than 10 stock will not be imported.

Any stock items which cost over $1000 will not be imported.

Any stock item marked as discontinued will be imported, but will have the discontinued

date set as the current date.

Any items which fail to be inserted correctly need to be listed in a report at the end of the

import process.

**Hints**

Look for existing solutions/libraries that could help organize the import code and all the rules in a nice OO program.

**Additional Considerations**

Because the data is from an external source, it may present certain issues.

These include:

1. Whether the data is correctly formatted for CSV

2. Whether the data is correctly formatted for use with a database

3. Potential data encoding issues or line termination problems

4. Manual interference with the file which may invalidate some entries

Either address these concerns in the code or indicate in your response how you would

tackle these issues if you had more time to develop your script.
